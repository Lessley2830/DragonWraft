I worked on coding, design, and research alongside a great team. The main goal was to create an exciting and fun game by combining different skills to make the game both enjoyable and functional.

I also gained experience in collaborating within a team, solving challenges that arose during development, and how to make a game feel engaging. Working on this game was a truly enjoyable experience, and I learned a lot while contributing to the overall creation of Dragon Wraft.
